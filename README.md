# Scramble-string

## Demo

http://scramble-string.herokuapp.com/

## Intro
What started off as me wanting to write a script to scramble my friend's dancer name for his
birthday (being that his name was "Scramblelock"), ended up 
turning into, "Hey, why I don't make it into website?", and so the rest is history. 😎 

Because after all... nothing says "Happy Birthday" quite like a Birthday website! (E-cards, you
 can take a seat! 😉)

## Tools Used
